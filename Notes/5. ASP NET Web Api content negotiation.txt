Client should be able to decide the format of response to get from the server. eg: xml, josn
When client sends the request it can specify the response format using accept-header. Accept:application/xml,
Accept:application/Json 

If you inspect in fiddler based on the format specified in request header we get response which can be verified in
content-type of response header.

The controller in case of get verb once it has retrieved the dataset will hand it over to the web api pipeline
which based on the response type requested by the client will return the resource in that format. 

Web api uses formatter classes to return resource in that format and this is called media type formatter.

Web api is customisable so we can implement our own formatter class for the resource to be returned

Multiple values can also be specified in accept header as application/xml, application/json but it will pick the first one 

you can also specify quality factor application/xml;q=0.8, application/json;q=0.5. In this case xml has got highest quality factor 

If accept header is not set default is JSON format.

When we send request to the server, we need to specify the content type so that the server is aware of what format we are sending the data.

The formatter are used by the server for both request/response messages. These formatters are called media type formatters.

You can set the media type formatters in WebApiConfig.cs file by using config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings = NewtonSoft.Json.Formatting.Indented
config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.ContractResolver = new CamelcasePropertyNamesContractResolver
