1. Implement Put method in ASP.Net Web api

Create a public void delete() method in employeescontroller. Pass employee id as parameter to update and employee object. 
The employee object parameter will be supplied by the requestbody.so decorate with frombody

public void Put(int id, [FromBody]string value)
        {
            strings[id] = value;
        }

use the same level of http status code handling for put request as well 

Move to fidder. Go to composer tab, copy the API url and select delete as method from the dropdown. and also provide employee id
to delete 

It looks fine but if you look at the response header its 204 content not found, this is becuase the return type of delete method is void.
Also if you choose to delete an items which is not in collection we get 500 internal server error.


As standard approach for rest service we should be returning the status codes where when delete is successful its 200 and 404 for item
not found 

Change the void return type to HTTPResponseMessage, declare a new variable called response message
  try
            {
                var sString = strings.ElementAt(id);

                if (sString == null)
                {
                    return Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, "Id not found");
                }
                else
                {
                    return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
                }

            }
            catch(Exception e)
            {
                return Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, e);
            }
