Default convention to map http verbs to methods in a controller - By default the http verb is mapped to a method
in a controller which has the same name or starts with the verb name.

HTTP Verb get is mapped to method: Get() or GetEmployee() or GetSomething()

If the method name is not get or doesn't start with the word get. it will fail with error 
The requested resource doesn't support http method Get - Status code 405 Not allowed
If we decorate the method with keyword [HttpGet] we can resolve the issue 

We have other attribute to map custom methods in a controller class to Get, Post, Put and Delete Http Verbs
