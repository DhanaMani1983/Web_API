Creating Web API Project
#################################################################

1. To create web api project. Open visual studio 2015. Create new project, select web give it a name and select next and select web api type.

if you come across with errors package installation errors - could not add all required packages
or failed to initalise the powershell host. 

To resolve the issue, close all instance of visual studio, open powershell by going to all apps. go to w and select windows powershell folder 
Run powershell as administrator, if security prompt comes up press R(Run once). Then type SET Execution policy Allsigned 

2. Lets explore the auto generated code by project.

Just like an MVC project. Web Api project has model, views and controller. If you expand controller you should be able to see
MVC controller and web api controller. Both are different Web Api controller values controller inherits from API controller and is 
in namespace system.web.http. MVC controller Home controller inherits from controller class and is in namespace system.web.mvc 

Values controller class will have verbs Get, Post, Put, Delete. controller has got two overloaded method get. one to return list and another a record.
based on the value passed as parameter in uri, subsequent method gets called 

To look at default route, open global.asax where we will application_start event handler method. which gets called when application starts.
Configuration for web api is stored in webapi.register web api class is stored in app_start folder. we can default route configured here.
Web api routes are different from MVC routes becuase MVC routes are present in RouteConfig.cs 

3. To run the project, hit f5. once the localhost gets loaded. as per the route type api/name of the controller as below

http://localhost_8080/api/values

The above request gets mapped to values controller and default get method method is called which returns the values
