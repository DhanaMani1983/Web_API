What is Web API

1. What is ASP.NET web api?

ASP.NET web api is a framework for building web api's. HTTP based services on top of .net framework 

Use case for web api is building restful services. 

2. These services can be consumed by broad range of clients like

Browser, Mobile Applications, Desktop Applications, IoT - Internet of Things are objects and devices that have an IP address
and can communicate over internet and internet enabled devices and objects. examples of IoTs include security systems, electronic
devices, thermostats in cars, homes and also desktops, laptops and smartphones.

Web api is mainly use to create restful services and also it can be use to create services which are not restful. 

2. Restful services - Rest stands for Representational state transfer. Rest is an architectural pattern to create services over http as 
communication method.
Rest dictates set of contraints which are 

ClientServer - Client sends a request and Server responds to the client with a response message.
Stateless - Communication between server and client should be stateless for each request. which means we should not be storing
anything related to the client on the server. The request send by the client should have all necessary information needed to process the 
request. Reason being each request can be treated independently. 
Cacheable - Server sends resource like list of customer or list of clients. If this data doesn't change, server provides timeline for how
long the data is valid 
Uniform interface - UI defines the interface between client and server. To understand uniform interface you need to understand resource and http verbs.
Resource represent data entities eg list of employees or customers. http verb is get, post, put, delete. http verbs tell server what to do.
each resource is identified by a uri. 

http://webaddress or company domain/employees with verb get is used to get employees
http://webaddress or company domain/employees/1 with verb get is used to get an employee
http://webaddress or company domain/employees with verb post is used to add an employee
http://webaddress or company domain/employees/1 with verb put is used to update an employee
http://webaddress or company domain/employees/1 with verb delete is used to delete an employee

HATEOS 
Layered system
Code on demand

3. different between WCF and Web API - WCF can be used to create Restful services, then why do you need to use Web API
because to create REST in WCF we need to set lot of configurations. so its not straight forward. 

When to use WCF over ASP.Net web api - Creating services that are transport/protocol independant. single service with multiple end points ie. java client
which needs http protocol and xml message and another .net client with tcp protocol and binary message format. 
You have existing SOAP service to support but want to extend with restful services.
.Net 3.5 limitation
